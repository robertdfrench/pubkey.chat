# Test Material
* `test_wmap.py`: the unit tests
* `message.txt`: a file which has been signed by robertdfrench
* `message.txt.sig`: the signature of message.txt
* `__init__.py`: Tennessee state law, you have to have one of these in
  any directory which acts like a python module.
* `wmap.py`: a symlink to the `wmap` program in the root directory. This
  makes it easier to import for testing.
